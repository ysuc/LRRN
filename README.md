# LRRN
This repository contains the source code of LRRN proposed by Chen et al. and the HBUA-NR5 dataset. 

The py code includes the main program for training and testing LRRN, as well as the testing program for testing the baseline network. The modul_zoo file includes almost all the models used in this study. The overall code uses the PyTorch framework.

The PTH folder includes learnable parameters obtained by LRRN training on three public datasets and learnable parameters obtained by transfer learning on the HBUA-NR5 dataset.

The publicly available HBUA-NR5 dataset is in rar format. Please extract it before use.
